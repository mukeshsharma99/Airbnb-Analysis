              <bucket>&quot;Bedford Stuyvesant is a diverse, vibrant, and wonderful mash up of culture, color, age, and economic level. The neighborhood has been predominantly African American since the 1930&apos;s. Before that, the area was a mix of Germans, Irish, Jewish, and Italians. Recently, there has been an influx of immigrants from the Caribbean and Mexico, and from other Brooklyn and Manhattan neighborhoods. These brownstone lined streets are shared by the rich and the poor alike,  with a mutual respect for each other.  We are living in a dense urban environment, with all of its pros and cons. All around us on Hancock Street are working class families, Wall Street types, writers, artists, social workers, city workers, and professionals of all kinds. As I write this, kids across the street are playing a pick up game of basketball.  The music of Brooklyn. This is a real neighborhood with real history.  As more people move into the neighborhood, more shops, restaurants, and bars are opening to join the ones tha&quot;</bucket>

Petits théâtres intimes multifonctionnels, friperies et épiceries fines ajoutent au bouillonnement culturel et à l’ambiance bohème qui caractérisent le Plateau, où convergent tous les modes de vie. C’est assurément ici que l’on a la meilleure idée de ce qu’est réellement Montréal. On y trouve une population principalement francophone et totalement éclectique. Artistes, étudiants, jeunes professionnels et nouvelles familles se mêlent aux diverses communautés culturelles, créant une mosaïque humaine extraordinairement vivante et colorée.\&quot; Voir la carte pour les restaurants, bars et parcs que nous recommandons dans le quartier, à distance de marche.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;I love West Chelsea. Galleries, the Highline, Chelsea Market, Hudson River...  That is why I chose it to live in NYC. I am often asked for restaurant recommendations and I always find it hard as it is so personal but here are some: The Red Cat: One of NYC&apos;s first farm to table restaurants is a fabulous option. It is small, dishes are carefully prepared and one can taste the freshness in the ingredients The Cookshop: making a name for itself amongst the trendy gang. It is also a Farm to Table and booking is recommended at brunch Oysters at the Cult and Pistol in the Chelsea Market are unbeatable in NYC Don Giovani is a great pizzeria if you want to eat in or take away And the unmissable NYC cocktails can be found at: The Standard Hotel (go there early for incredible views, overpriced drinks and an unforgettable experience); the Americano Hotel (recently opened and has cocktails with a twist of Mexican in a decent rooftop), The McKittrick Hotel (the rooftop is gorgeous for brunch, or go &quot;</bucket>

This is an old fashioned family area with respectful residents... it is a blending of the old and the new, both the family generations and their homes. This is most definitely a small vintage town feel in a residential area of Oahu with local flair. There is a strong cohesiveness and lively sense of longevity. It&apos;s common to see neighbors visit in the yards and help one another with whatever is going on and everyone has a friendly word to say or at least a smile and wave. You will also commonly see fishermen all along the beach, as well as outrigger canoe rowers practicing when in season. This area has many popular activities including fishing, surfing, boogie boarding and snorkeling. You will see all these happening daily along with local families coming and going for their daily routines. It&apos;s definitely authentic residential Hawaii.&quot;</bucket>

Ao contrário do que se pensa, o nome do bairro não vem da existência de grandes laranjais na parte baixa do vale do Rio Carioca e sim da sua semelhança com a acidentada região de Laranjeiras na região mais alta de Lisboa, o que levou à nomeação do bairro carioca. Laranjeiras ainda guarda o charme dos bairros marcados pelo passado e foi o endereço de nobres, escritores, compositores e pessoas ilustres, como Villa-Lobos, Cecília Meirelles, Portinari, Oscar Niemeyer e Cássia Eller&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;My place is in the middle of Besiktas-Nisantasi and Taksim. Besiktas is the leading culture, art and education capital and district of Istanbul as well as one of the most valuable regions of Istanbul with its Ortakoy, Arnavutkoy, Kurucesme and Bebek neighborhoods located by the Bosphorus. Nisantasi, Istanbul’s equivalent to London’s Chelsea or New York’s Upper East Side, used to be dominated by strawberry orchards in the 18th century. It was here that the sultan’s soldiers used to train their target, hence its name – Nisantasi means “target stone “ .Taksim Square is the center of Istanbul today, and Beyoglu has a very nice pedestrian street.  Besiktas is the best place to observe the lively Istanbul city life. It is also the popular meeting point as well as the most important junction for sea transportation. Besiktas also hosts the historical heritage of the Ottomans, culture and art with its Dolmabahce, Ciragan and Yildiz Palace. Besiktas is also one of the best places to see in Istan&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Source: Wikipédia Depuis les années 1980, le Mile End est connu comme un quartier à vocation largement artistique, peuplé par des artistes, des musiciens, des écrivains et des cinéastes. On y retrouve de nombreuses galeries d&apos;art, des ateliers de designers, des boutiques et des cafés. L&apos;entreprise de logiciels d&apos;infographie 3D Discreet Logic a marqué le quartier en rénovant un étage d&apos;une ancienne usine de textiles au début des années 1990. En 1997, cet espace devient les nouveaux studios montréalais du développeur de jeux vidéo Ubisoft, agrandis par la suite pour occuper la majeure partie de l&apos;immeuble. Le Mile End est nettement plus fortuné et plus populaire depuis le milieu des années 1990 : l&apos;augmentation des loyers et l&apos;apparition de nouvelles boutiques haut de gamme en témoignent. Récemment, le Mile End fut considéré par plusieurs magazines musicaux spécialisés, notamment Spin et Pitchfork, comme le cœur de la scène musicale indépendante de Montréal.

              <bucket>&quot;O’ahu is a Mecca of tourism with very few simple neighborhoods by the sea. Few will ever stay in a local home by paths to uniquely different beaches without a single hotel in sight. An hour drive out of Waikiki you will pass through every spectrum of life on Oahu and stop being a tourist. You will discover the hidden hawaii not accessible at fancy hotels or ocean front mansions. Tucked away is the pineapple surf shack where you can sleep under classic surfboards, taste local fruit, or rinse the sand off in outdoor hot showers. Cross the courtyard to get a 90 minute massage or take a Hidden path near by to a secret cove where sea turtles rest and the sunsets are amazing! Note: Makaha is a one hour drive North of Honolulu, depending on traffic. You will need a rental car for your trip if you are visiting other parts of the island as we are not centrally located. We are looking for open minded, respectful and kind individuals and families who want a local experience.&quot;</bucket>

That’s a bit of an unfortunate reputation because the folk that live around here know just how charming and spectacular the booming area can be. By the water there’s newly developed park land that shows off the Sydney’s incredible sandstone cliffs and high-end dining establishments that feed the city’s power offices (both (Hidden by Airbnb) and Fairfax are in the wharfs). Further inland there’s hip cafes like Clementine’s and Miam and a surprisingly multicultural food scene - try Kopitiam for Malaysian, Vic’s Meats for American barbecue, and Willis Canteen for Indonesian.       Then there’s the big draws, the Fish Markets and the Casino itself – not for gambling though, simply because it contains some of best restaurants in Sydney.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;The Fener-Balat quarter, is a great area to walk around and safe to do so.  Whilst it is becoming trendy it retains it historical character. You will often see Brides having photos or children playing soccer in the streets.  The roads are quite narrow and go in all directions, the slopes can get steep but the cobblestones, among coloured Ottoman houses, some superbly restored, others irremediably ruined, that one can feel the history of Istanbul.  Rum Lisesi, the Greek Orthodox College, the magnificent and peculiar red-brick building that dominates the hill of Fener. Climbing up a picturesque staircase one will then reach the top of the hill, where once the ancient walls of Constantinople ran, and it is precisely here that in the 13th century was built a church unknown to most, but of fundamental importance in the history of the city. This is the graceful Church of St. Mary of the Mongols, also known as the Red Church. The neighbourhood of Fener is situated one of the most important lo&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;The neighborhood is close to the center but far enough to avoid the hustle and bustle of the city. This was a typical neighborhood populated by workers of Porto that served in the hat and weaving factory. Now the factory has been transformed into an artistic foundation, the Fábrica Social - Fundação Escultor José Rodrigues (he is the author of the Ribeira cube sculpture)] that usually hosts exhibitions, laboratories and workshops. At the back of the Fábrica remains one of the most curious places of Porto ... and one of my favorites! A series of &apos;ruin&apos; houses that this foundation - instead of demolishing them - gave an original approach to it when in 2010 it hosted the &apos;Visual Street Performance&apos; event. This event brought together graffiters from all over the country and also from abroad to paint street art Live. The art remained there and only a few know that behind the building of master José Rodrigues&apos; studio there are graffiti works by HBSR, Hium, Klit, Mars, Vhils, Youth One, by Po&quot;</bucket>

Culture Beyond the glass and steel of Hong Kong’s commercial persona, the city also boasts a vibrant cultural scene that features the eclectic influences of its Chinese roots, colonial connections and a wondrous pool of homegrown talent. Here, you’re just as likely to find yourself applauding at Asia’s top film festival as joining in dawn taichi or reading the couplets of a local poet to the drumbeat of a dragon boat. Culture could also mean indie music under the stars, a classy art walk, your first Cantonese opera – not to mention the exhibitions and events staged year-round at the many museums and concert halls. Why I Love Hong Kong I love Hong Kong because it has a complexity that eludes definition, sometimes even by its own people.

              <bucket>&quot;Williamsburg Brooklyn is undeniably the trendiest neighborhood in NYC right now. It doesn&apos;t get more fun that this. I used to live in Manhattan, but now that I actually see the city skyline every day, I feel even more like a New Yorker.  Williamsburg is typically know for: outdoor festivals, live music, art, vintage stores, new designers, cutting edge food, rooftop parties, fashion, bike culture, hipsters, interior design, and my favorite part about Brooklyn: a friendly neighborhood community. We are in Williamsburg proper here at Bedford Ave, not just a nearby subway stop to it or a far walk away. The waterfront area is the most desirable part of Williamsburg, and Bedford ave is the main street. Everything is close, and neighborhood is safe. There are people out and about all day/night hitting the nearby restaurants and bars. This is the first subway stop in Brooklyn from Manhattan, and the first Brooklyn neighborhood right off the bridge.&quot;</bucket>

At local coffee shops, like Devocion, Toby&apos;s Estate, and Blue Bottle, you can hang out with more hipsters than probably where else in the world. The nightlife is probably Williamsburg&apos;s strongest feature, with several excellent cocktail bars nearby (I especially like Hotel Delmano and Maison Premiere), many options for live music, as well as the two best nightclubs in NYC (Verboten and Output). In summer, there&apos;s the outdoor foodie market Smorgasburg. There&apos;s excellent shopping at unique boutiques: escape the chain stores and global luxury labels that now dominate Manhattan.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;One of Sydney’s grandest suburbs, Mosman is located just 8kms from the CBD over the Sydney Harbour Bridge. It’s a suburb many aspire to live in and once you’re there, there’s little reason to leave, with plenty of shops along Military Road, stunning scenery and even the iconic Taronga Zoo to keep you amused. Balmoral Beach offers a more relaxed atmosphere, with parks, swimming and beachside cafes. It’s tempting to stay at home and get lost in the harbour view from your balcony, but at some point it’s important to leave the house. A walk through Mosman is an excellent workout due to the inevitable hill-climbing challenges. There’s a community bus for short trips and plenty of buses into the CBD; or the ferry if you prefer a water crossing. Small clumps of village shops include delicatessens, bakeries and specialty gift stores, while the major shopping precinct is located on Military Road.&quot;</bucket>

Once on the train it&apos;s less than 25 minutes to Manhattan. This is Brooklyn, not Manhattan. There will be some travel time to get to Manhattan, in my opinion, not too much. The neighborhood is safe, but can be a culture shock for some. It&apos;s not the upper west side or midtown, keep that in mind. I love my neighborhood!&quot;</bucket>

Travel to the city by light rail (tram), by bus, an inexpensive taxi or simply walk.  In Glebe besides fantastic food, there are bookshops, fashion stores and collectables. On Saturday visit Glebe Markets on the grounds of Glebe Public School.  &apos;The Glebe&apos; was given to the church by the Governour in the first few years of European settlement as a means for the church to support itself.  Most of the suburb was sub-dived and built upon in the 1880&apos;s and the vast majority of the terraces you&apos;ll see today were built in that era. Workers unions and left wing politicians managed to fend off building developers in the 1970&apos;s resulting in charming terraced townhouses and cottages surviving so close the the city skyscrapers.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Flatbush is a multi-cultural neighborhood in the heart of Brooklyn. What makes this area unique is the original architecture and the influence of a vastly diverse array of ethnicities who call this middle-class family neighborhood their home.  To the non-New Yorker exploring Brooklyn may seem like navigating a foreign country, but I encourage everyone to explore with an open mind as there is much more than meets the eye! The area is very safe both day and night and has a  neighborhood feel. Our street is lined with small restaurants and bodega&apos;s offering the best in no-frills culturally diverse cuisine. I would dare say that this area of Flatbush is a diamond in the rough to those who truly want a real and amazing Brooklyn experience!  You will find shopping markets for basic essentials right down the block along with a laundry mat only a few blocks away. The area is also very quiet aside from the sound of vehicles, which is almost unavoidable anywhere you travel in the five boroughs. &quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;The East Village (EV) is known for its cool bars and nightlife, great restaurants, and music venues. It is very hipster, artsy and unique. My block, specifically, is a living reminder of the East Village&apos;s punk-rock past. Significant moments in counterculture history happened all along the street: Abbie Hoffman invented the Yippies at No. 30 in 1967; Andy Warhol, the Velvet Underground, and Jimi Hendrix performed at now-gone experimental nightclub Electric Circus, before it closed in 1971; and gallery 51X backed eighties-era graffiti artists like Keith Haring and Basquiat. Today, the street&apos;s grasp on culture lies mostly within its diverse restaurants (frankfurters at Crif Dogs, Israeli cuisine at Hummus Place) and storefronts. And though these aren’t quite as anti-establishment as they once were—there’s nothing too rebellious about sidewalk vendors hawking plastic sunglasses—some glam stalwarts still remain, like Trash &amp; Vaudeville and Andy&apos;s Chee-Pees, where you can still sift throug&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;The neighborhood here is very nice. It is generally quiet except for the occasional firetruck, or sometimes local parties by neighbors. Shutting a window keeps out most noise. It is NYC after all, so it&apos;s not rural quiet. Saint Pauls avenue is filled with old Victorian houses that are very nice to see and create a pleasant area. There are restaurants nearby, and a store about 4 blocks away for food items and other needs. It is about 12 minutes to walk to the Ferry or 2-5 minutes by bus. The areas towards the Ferry can appear run down in some spots. Again, this is NYC, filled with a great diversity of people. The area is safe, but it is not Disneyland.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;About the NEIGHBORHOOD:::      The neighborhood is Flatbush, bordering Ditmas Park and Prospect-Lefferts Gardens. This is NOT hipster paradise, and it&apos;s NOT gangster&apos;s paradise either!  Our neighborhood is very residential and typically quieter than most urban cities. The summertime is louder on the block because very few people have air conditioning and enjoy hanging outside. The neighbors are friendly, so say hello as you pass! The ages of the neighborhood are very diverse (young children to elderly homeowners who have been here for 40 years). Flatbush has a lot of local charm and people with hearts of gold.  Jamaican food is plentiful (jerk chicken- yeah!); there is also a local donut shop nearby, Subway, Thai, sushi, pizza, and Indian food for delivery or a 5-15 minute walk to the restaurant, as well as many chain stores like Dominos, Dunkin&apos; Donuts, IHOP, and Walgreens drug store. There is also a Planet Fitness (handy for Black-Card members!) Just a 10 minute walk down the road is&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Gracia used to be a separate town on the edge of Barcelona until it was absorbed by its larger neighbour. It is renowned for the fact that it has always managed to maintain an independent character from the rest of the city. The neighbourhood is richly cultural, from the diversity of people walking its streets to street parties, human towers, live music and fireworks, a wide variety of restaurants, and cinemas, theatres and galleries. The unique architecture also adds a charm of its own. The narrow streets, little squares and small buildings are reminiscent of the town it used to be, but the spectrum of restaurants, bars, shops and cinemas betray its status as a part of Barcelona, Catalunya’s capital city. Gracia offers the choice of quiet sleepy side streets alongside the life and bustle of its squares.&quot;</bucket>

The thriving high street, which extends from Erskineville train station towards Newtown, offers up the coffee, brunch and gourmet delights. Despite sitting shoulder to shoulder, the small-scale terrace homes that crowd the narrow streets all possess a distinct sense of personality. Erskineville may well be one of the hottest inner city spots, but it hasn’t sacrificed any of its charm by way of jarring developments. Erskineville’s creative conscience runs deep. From the colourful residents, the dramatic drinking dens, fringe theatre at PACT, to the gourmet food stores and cafes, there’s a sense of thinking differently here that’s embedded within the tight-knit community. There’s an Erskineville way of looking at Sydney, which makes it one of the most prized lifestyle po&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;I live between 2 of the best districts in Istanbul: Beşiktaş and Nişantaşı.  While the first is more bohemian, very lively, famous for its night-life and  next to the Bosporus, the later is much more affluent, elegant and full of specialized restaurants and internationally renown designer shops. Both are pretty, safe, very central and share an exiting lifestyle.  Everything is steps away or very nearby; gorgeous parks, mosques, Taksim and the TOP TOURIST ATTRACTIONS.  I&apos;m surrounded by a huge array of cafes, restaurants, shops, bars and live music venues; all this contributes to making Beşiktaş one of the most sort after districts in Istanbul. Yet I live at a quiet and safe street. Witin 1 to 2 min walk: a hospital and pharmacy (at the corner) 3 supermarkets, including the cheapest chain in all of Turkey.

As trendy restaurants, bars and boutiques popped up in Nolita’s winding streets, the area started developing a separate identity from the surrounding neighborhoods. Similar to SoHo, Nolita is known for its architecture and “hip” reputation. However, Nolita lacks the high density of tourists that flock to its neighbors, allowing for a more local feel. Known for its fashionable retail, young residents and expensive apartments, Nolita is slowly splitting from its association with SoHo and Little Italy, maturing into a full-fledged neighborhood.&quot;</bucket>

It has a great community atmosphere and it&apos;s hard to walk down the street to the beach without running into people we know. We know and love lots of the cafe and restaurant owners in the area, and have made friends with lots of the neighbours.  The beach is the highlight of the area, and it&apos;s right across the street! Maroubra beach is 1km long and is popular for surfing, swimming, a BBQ, a nice spot to sit and have lunch/dinner or just a walk to get some fresh air, space and relax. It&apos;s less crowded than its neighbour up in Bondi, but no less beautiful. To the south end there is a reserve with no buildings or houses, so it&apos;s particularly beautiful looking down the sand and waves to the trees and headland.

              <bucket>&quot;Williamsburg is the epicenter of Brooklyn as a fashionable worldwide brand. The neighborhood may have rents higher than Gramercy and more crowds than Soho, but it’s popular for a reason: The quaint streets are lined with inventive New York restaurants, rooftop bars and eclectic shops, and throngs of people flock to the waterfront for flea markets and giant food bazaars during the summer. Once among the city’s most industrial neighborhoods, Williamsburg emerged as the gritty epicenter of New York’s counter-culture in the late 1980’s. The plentiful supply of dormant factories and warehouses served as a useful landscape for many of the city’s most significant and pioneering visual artists, musicians, poets, and experimental theater. By the late 90’s, Williamsburg became an international icon as a “hipster-haven” and a hotbed of youth culture. Today, Williamsburg remains one of New York’s most vibrant and trendy neighborhoods; and a destination for those seeking chic restaurants, independe&quot;</bucket>

It is located in Central and Western District, on the north shore of Hong Kong Island, across Victoria Harbour from Tsim Sha Tsui, the southernmost point of Kowloon Peninsula.

Consulates general and consulates of many countries are also located in this area, as is Government Hill, the site of the government headquarters.

              <bucket>&quot;Dear Guest,  Welcome to İstanbul! It is really one of the most beautiful cities on the world: Historical, picturesque, colorful land full of contrasts.  East and west meet in Istanbul. Istanbul is ancient, Istanbul is modern. Sweet comes always after spicy but they are next to each other but never mix. Sadness turns to happiness in Istanbul.  Sometimes you would feel it is crowded, chaotic and noisy. If you want to make a break and breath, Istanbul has very calm corners as well.  Heybeliada is one of Istanbul’s peaceful spots. It is a small island next to Istanbul. This is actually one of a group of Island and called Prince&apos;s Islands. There is no traffic, no motor vehicles on the Islands and transportation is made by horse cars or bicycles. With its beautiful houses island is like an open air architecture museum. Islands are one of the must to see spots if you stay in Istanbul longer than couple days. If you would like to spend time on the island my friend has a beautiful house with a &quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Early 1900&apos;s Williamsburg was a financial place rivaling Wall street, with banks and industry booming. Back then the Domino Sugar factory was even the largest sugar refinery in the world. The 21 st century gentrification that started after the 1960&apos;s decline clearly bounces off that rich history and now Williamsburg has become the most sought after neighborhood of all New York. Median price is highest in real estate, it ranks number 1 in gentrification in New York and 7th across the Nation. Big brands have already opened new stores here and more are constantly coming. The best restaurants, bars, cafes are opening a second location with great success. You won&apos;t want to go to Manhattan but if you needed to it is just one stop away with the J/M/Z or L train!&quot;</bucket>

There is nothing between us and the ocean but the ranch land comprised mostly of  tropical forest.  While we have neighbors on both sides, Hale Honu is very private with many plantings and trees on the property lines.  We are mid-way between Hookena Beach State Park to the south, and Place of Refuge National Historic Park to the north, which is adjacent to \&quot;Two Step,\&quot; one of the best snorkeling locations on the Big Island.  The Hookena Beach bay area is also the play ground and resting place for a pod of dolphins that are often seen during early mornings or evenings. It is a ten minute drive to either of these locations, and a short walk to a small convenience store in the central village.  We are 70 miles from Volcano National Park - a 90 minute drive of spectacular scenery.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Greenwich is a hidden gem of Sydney.  It&apos;s close to the city and even closer to the restaurant districts of Lane Cove and Crows Nest.  Because it&apos;s a harbourside suburb, and this is Sydney,  the terrain is hilly and quite steep in parts and the views are breathtaking.    The suburb has wonderful urban, green, pretension-free, harbourside vibe.  It&apos;s a great place for hiking.  If golf&apos;s your thing, there&apos;s  a public golf course just up the road.  An absolute must see is the iconic Greenwich baths, one of the few remaining Sydney Harbour public swimming baths.    It you love to work your muscles, there are many parks with outdoor training facilities (the best is at the bottom of my garden),  tennis courts for hire, an aquatic centre in Lane Cove, all this with great transport links to the CBD for the business traveller.  What&apos;s not to like?  There&apos;s a reason that most who move to Greenwich tend to trade up and stay in the vicinity rather than moves to other parts of Sydney.&quot;</bucket>

Its a very convenient neighbourhood, however its on a quiet street and close to cafés and restaurants.  The apartment is located an easy walk to the neighbourhoods of Newtown, Redfern and Chinatown and walkable (2.5km) to Darling Harbour. For groceries, I recommend going to the SPAR supermarket at Redfern station.  This old Sydney neighbourhood is predominately made up of lovely old terraces but there are also many green spaces nearby.  There is a cafe is located just across the street, and there is a quiet boutique pub just next to it. There&apos;s also an organic tea shop just down the street too. Guests should try: * Going to the Harbour, I can suggest going for a walk across the bridge! You can also walk up a Harbour Bridge pylon (The South east one) for $13, or for something really special, book a bridgeclimb. Make sure you see the Opera House, and the entry to the Botannical Gardens is just behind it. *&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Not long ago, I overheard a conversation between a middle-aged French-Canadian couple standing on Moon Street, guidebook in hand. \&quot;Apparently, this is one of the last authentic neighbourhoods left,\&quot; said one of them, looking around. \&quot;You know, with little shops and low density, as opposed to all those giant monstrosities you see everywhere else.\&quot; It wasn&apos;t an unfair assessment. Through a quirk of geography, Star, Sun, Moon and St Francis streets have become an island of tranquility in a congested city. Even as the high-rises encroach, the neighbourhood&apos;s dead-end streets, narrow alleyways and leafy squares retain their quietude, a quality complemented by an eclectic range of businesses that see the area&apos;s calm as an asset. \&quot;All of this makes the neighbourhood very precious,\&quot; says architect Christopher Law.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Der Küste der Copacabana ist 4,5 km lang, die Strandpromenade aus Stein ist ein Werk des Landschaftsarchitekten Burle Marx verziert mit Wellen wie vom Meer. Über das Seebad können Besucher die Promenade zu Fuß erreichen. Im Sommer ist es üblich, dass Menschen Nachts ein Bad im Meer genießen, weil die Hitze im Rio sehr stark ist und das Meer von Copacabana sich in einen Mondschein-Pool verwandelt. Die Aussicht ist oft erstaunlich!  In Copacabana gibt es auch zwei Festungen, die besichtigt werden können, die  befinden sich an einem Ende des Strandes. Eine von ihnen ist das Fort von Copacabana. In der Nacht bietet der Strand ein Höchstmaß an Spaß und Erholung, Kioske, Bars und Restaurants sind an der Küste und in den nahe gelegenen Alleen. Die Restaurants servieren die typischsten Getränke von Rio De Janeiro, wie Caipirinha, und auch weitere würzige Snacks.&quot;</bucket>

A market nearby if you wish to buy ingredients and cook yourself as well. This is a neighborhood where you can find old and new blend in very well with each other - where you can find really cheap food, at the same time expensive or newly opened fusion restaurants. Of course, not only food, there are 3 supermarkets nearby, a famous Guanyin temple (good for career blessing), 10 mins walk to the habor (where people exercises in that area too)... basically it is a super convenient neighborhood in Hong Kong (not to mention how it is located in the centre of Hong Kong, just one station next to Tsim Sha Tsui, or Mongkok.&quot;</bucket>

Or you can always buy some genuine produce in the grocery stores next door, take it home and cook your own portuguese inspired meal.&quot;</bucket>

This grid-patterned area was created in the  19th century to accommodate the overflowing population from old Barcelona; luckily this coincided with Barcelona’s golden age of architecture..  Gaudí, Puig I Cadafalch, Domènech I Montaner were employed by the wealthy to  build townhouses, each one more daring than the last… The  Eixample district is divided in two, the Eixample Dreta (right side) and  Eixample Esquerra (left side), this divide is marked by Passeig de &quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Freshwater is one of the Sydneys best beach suburbs most versatile places. Perfect for adults, couples, families and kids, it has everything you need for a relaxed stay in Sydney.   The beach is beautiful, and perfect for swimming or learning to surf (depending the waves).  The sun rises over the ocean, and there’s nothing better than diving into the ocean or using the awesome salt water pool if you want to get some lengths in at sunrise or enjoy the ocean without the waves. There’s also plenty of space to relax on the rocks if the sand is not your thing.  Within 100m of the beach are 3 cafes, including the epic Pilu Cafe for a coffee with ocean views, and the trendy Cafe Calm for an afternoon burger and beer after all the hard work at the beach!  To kick start your day after a morning swim, venture into Freshie Village (only about 500m from the beach) for even more epic cafes. Fuel up with great food, a coffee and a smoothie before you tackle the surf! There’s also the best bakery in &quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;For a real traveller, living in Gracia it&apos;s a great opportunity since there are no endless crowds of tourists. It is a true Catalan neighborhood where traditions and the authentic atmosphere of Barcelona are still preserved. Anyway, it is very easy to reach the centre of the city from there. The apartment is very close to Sagrada Familia, Park Guell and it is only 5 minutes by bike or metro from Passeig de Gracia, where the tourist area begins. But you’ll have plenty of time to see the main attractions, it is better to stay a bit in Gracia, because it&apos;s worth it!  Start your day in one of the cafes that serves fresh coffee and pastries, after get lost on the winding streets of this amazing quarter. For lunch go to the Plaça del Sol and feel free to choose any of the restaurants there. Be sure to order homemade vermouth before your meal, this drink is very popular among the locals.&quot;</bucket>

This area is still free from large flashy signs and has a lot of amazing restaurants and bars to offer. The BEST in the country! You&apos;ve even got chic clothing boutiques, hip coffee shops, and parks in case you want to take a jog. Don&apos;t know where to find the boutiques? I&apos;ll circle them on the map for you. THIS IS STILL A VERY \&quot;LOCAL\&quot; NEW YORK SPOT. In fact, you can see the transition taking place right now. Is it safe? YES. There&apos;s a primary school across the street. You&apos;ll hear the kids playing when you&apos;re outside when school is in session. There&apos;s also a police department a few blocks south east. In general, New York is pretty safe. The movie depictions are pre-1990&apos;s The Williamsburg bridge is right nearby for a relaxing walk over the water! Gorgeous view from the rooftop :) More photos to come!&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Ipanema é um bairro nobre da cidade brasileira do Rio de Janeiro, fundado, em 1894, por José Antônio Moreira, conde de Ipanema. Faz divisa com os bairros de Copacabana, Leblon e Lagoa. Etimologia O nome dado pelos índios Ipanema significa \&quot;água ruim, rio sem peixes\&quot; em tupi-guarani. O nome faz referência a uma região em Sorocaba, onde José Antônio Moreira Filho ((PHONE NUMBER HIDDEN)), feito segundo barão de Ipanema em 1847 (e conde em 1868), tinha uma metalúrgica. Nessa mesma região, havia a Real Fábrica de Ferro São João do Ipanema, aos pés do Morro de Ipanema. Era um minerador e comprou as terras onde hoje está localizado o bairro carioca e decidiu homenagear seu local de nascimento, a vila de São João de Ipanema, hoje pertencente a cidade de Iperó. História O desenvolvimento da Zona Sul foi forçado pela chegada da corte portuguesa no século XIX, quando a população da cidade (capital na ocasião) passou de sessenta mil para quinhentos mil habitantes. A corte preferiu seguir rumo nort&quot;</bucket>

When the creatives started getting priced out of Mile End, it became time to look for newer pastures, but there seemed to be a psychological barrier to moving west. Today, the Mile-Ex is now the most interesting area in town, with cafés, restaurants, art-filled factories, and all the things that nurture and cultivate a creative crowd.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;HAPPY NEIGHBOURHOOD Paral.lel and Poble Sec are barrios included in the district called Montjuïc. Paral.lel is an avenue that cuts down from picturesque Plaça Espanya right down to the World Trade Centre at the tip of the port. Poble Sec is an area spreading out from the middle of Paral.lel. The areas are safe and primarily residential but there is much entertainment to be had as well. This includes popular bars, theatre and even a club. However, whilst Paral.lel is a busy thoroughfare during the day, the areas are quiet and just a 10-20 minute walk to the centre of the city and Las Ramblas.

              <bucket>&quot;I love walking the streets to get exercise. Cars are traveling slowly in the neighbourhood. Speed limit is 15 miles per hour. The swimming hole is two minutes away- go northwest on Kai street to find- its over by the bay. That&apos;s where we put kayaks in. There are tide pools in the village and the wharf is a great snorkeling place as is the swimming hole by the house. There really isnt a beach close to the house but drive  into the village of Milolii  , the last hawaiian fishing village,park, and hike  15 minutes into Honomolino Beach, a pretty, quiet, black sand beach with a patch of white on the southern part.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;While Şişli (read as Sheshly) is often regarded as one of the upscale districts in Istanbul, there’s a lot more to it than just 5 star hotels and shopping malls. For a taste of Turkish culture, you can find impressive museums, churches and mosques all around this opulent district. Going to Şişli really is an experience of contemporary Turkish life.  You can see;  Atatürk Museum (Atatürk Müzesi), located on Halaskargazi Street, Atatürk Museum is a three story house museum painted in pink. Atatürk, the founder and the first President of the Republic of Turkey, first used the house for storage and residential purposes, but it was later changed to a museum to exhibit some of the personal belongings of Atatürk and depict his lifetime through historical documents and photographs. Since Atatürk did actually live and work in the house during significant historical events like the War of Independence and invasion of Istanbul, you will have a true experience of Atatürk’s life and Turkish history&quot;</bucket>

These are our regulars: Ella Guru, 104A Swanson St, Erskineville NSW 2043 Closest cafe - very friendly and good value. Toasted sandwiches a great quick lunch. Meet Gerard,  54 Henderson Rd, Alexandria NSW 2015 Further to walk but our favourite by far. Excellent coffee and delicious breakfasts, cakes and sandwiches. If you need to get a train from Redfern Station (e.g. to go to Bondi Junction) then this is a good place to fuel up on caffeine on your walk to the station. Restaurants Again you’ll struggle to find a bad meal. There are a small number of restaurants along Erskineville Road which are all pretty good and if you venture to King Street...well you can have just about anything.  Here are the local places that draw us back agai&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;I love my neighborhood ! Daytime, nighttime, anytime, Montréal’s downtown is alive and kicking. It’s not called centre-ville for nothing: our downtown core is the very heart of the city that pulsates with the vibrant energy of its diverse inhabitants. Safely nestled between the river and the mountain, it’s our meeting place, our boardroom, our sanctuary, our playground; where students, professionals, artists, fashionistas, tourists—you name it—all converge for the daily 9 to 5, life’s amazing moments, special occasions; for shopping, going out, sight-seeing; for clubbing, dancing, culture. Soaring skyscrapers and heritage buildings intermingle with quaint boutiques in our compact and accessible downtown, making for a setting that is nothing less than spectacular. Above ground, Sainte-Catherine Street buzzes with shoppers, hip and trendy Crescent Street is the place to see and be seen while upscale and sophisticated Sherbrooke Street boasts high-end boutiques and world-class cultural in&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;It is a very central place, walking distance to main pedestrian streets full of cafes and restaurants, and also transportation hubs. 5 minutes walking distance to bus station, and 10 minutes to metro. There is a local market in the street on Sundays, which you can buy cheap and fresh vegetables and fruits with good quality. A small Carrefour and SOK supermarket is around the corner. Another local market is located just opposite the street, which you can buy all essentials. It is not a touristic neighborhood, more of a local, working class one. Municipality started a huge regeneration project couple of years ago, not too far from our street. This triggered the transformation of the area. Low-income families are moving out, and recently many students and foreigners have been moving in due to its location. We still have the traditional social life in our neighborhood. Next door carpenter and electrician, owner of the market, or the guys from the local tea house are great helps whenever we&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Kauai&apos;s north shore is unpoiled and serene, ideal for the outdoor enthusiast (even if your enthusiasm for the outdoors extends no further than the nearest sunny beach or a glass of wine on your private lanai).  The Princeville Shopping Center offers a grocery store, restaurants, boutiques, a yoga studio, and other businesses, and it&apos;s a pleasant walk along level ground to get there.  Several secluded beaches can be accessed by one of the beach paths (they&apos;re rather steep) that go down the bluff, or there&apos;s the lovely shady path to Anini Beach on the east side of Princeville.  The town of Hanalei, with its restaurants, bars, charming boutiques, and the fabulous beach at Hanalei Bay, is only about a 5 minute drive.  In the summer months, when the water is calm, you can even catch a boat tour of the Na Pali Coast out of Hanalei.  There are numerous hiking trails a short drive away.  You&apos;ll find beaches for whatever your favorite beach activity happens to be…surfing (or learning to surf), &quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;L’Eixample is one of the 10 districts of Barcelona. The creation of this district gave birth to the modern Barcelona, where the streets are very wide and there is a lot of urban life, very different from the “Ciutat Vella” district, which reflects the medieval history of the city. The Eixample is the most cosmopolitan area of Barcelona, with tons of stores (you will find many supermarkets and pharmacies very close by). The area very well connected with all kinds of public transport that take you from one end of the city to the other in no time. The main touristic attractions of this district are the Sagrada Familia, La Pedrera, the Casa Mila, Plaza de Catalunya and Passeig de Gràcia.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Tarlabasi neighborhood was a middle class Greek neighbourhood when it was founded at the beginning of 19th century. The area is full of houses of eclectic Ottoman liberty style buildings and ours is one of them.

              <bucket>&quot;Criada na segunda metade do século XIX, a Freguesia do Bonfim nasceu do surgimento de inúmeras fabricas e manufaturas, sendo a mais recente freguesia do Porto e a que mais cresceu na 2ª metade do sec XIX. No século XX começam a surgir os palacetes com os seus belos azulejos, que abrigavam a Burguesia portuense e casas de funcionários das fábricas. É na Rua do Bonfim, nº 234, um prédio dos anos 50 que hoje dá lugar ao Bonfim 234 Townhouse.  A área do Bonfim está a tornar-se numa área moderna onde tem surgido novos projetos entre galerias de artes, cafés, companhias de teatro. Uma zona propicia a deliciosos passeios pelas suas ruas repletas de edifícios históricos de onde sobressaem os seus azulejos. De nomear espaços como o café Mesa 325, o Pão Nosso com o seu pão orgânico delicioso, o Mira Forum com a sua galeria de Arte, os cocktail do Terraplana ou os pratos do Chef Pedro Limão onde pode degustar uma aventura de sabores.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;FAQ’s 1.Why Shangri’La?   Along with the uniqueness of this property, a one of a kind, Shangri’La offers “Old Hawaii” at its best with a Balinese flair.  The privacy, the lagoons, the 4 separate pavilions, the waterfall, endless palm trees, and 90 degree volcanically heated ocean water, the friendly fish, with 2 private islands, lend itself to the description we most hear from guests: “It’s Heaven on Earth!”  The indoor/ outdoor design makes you feel like you’re on a private island somewhere and completely one with the tropics.  It’s a magical place, as we continue to hear over and over again from our guests that it was “The vacation of their lifetimes.”  We also hear that the magic of Shangri’La brings families and couples closer, and they often credit Shangri’La for this bonding experience and how they wish they could stay there together forever. 2.Why is this area of Hawaii the only location that has 90-degree ocean water?   This is the most unique place to swim in the island becaus&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Life in our area is as rooted in cultural tradition as is it energized and diverse. In the last decade, restaurants like Red Rooster, Harlem Tavern, and Harlem Shake have reinvented a dining scene traditionally defined by soul food icons like Sylvia’s and Amy Ruth’s. The neighborhood is a national historic district in Manhattan, New York City. It consists of 113 contributing residential row-houses built between 1886 and 1896. The buildings are three story brownstone and brick row-houses over raised basements in the Queen Anne, Romanesque, and Neo-Grec styles.  There is a peaceful, residential spirit throughout the neighborhood, evidenced by street pick-up basketball games and block parties. But Harlem is also home to a thriving cultural scene, which brings a constant vibrancy and excitement to the neighborhood. In Harlem, weekend dining and coffee culture are as significant as the nightlife scene. Live jazz brunches at venues like Harlem Tavern and Ginny’s Supper Club attract diners wi&quot;</bucket>

Some  of the most important streets and   Avenue interconnects with this important square, famous for its fountain, and   statues. Until almost half of  19th century the Plaça de Catalunya was mainly a   rural zone located outside the city walls. It was only in 1858 that the Madrid&apos;s   central government finally ordered the defensive walls to be torn down.,   approving also the construction outside the walls so a public contest was   organized in search of a  design of a new district. The first place was awarded   to a design by Rovira i Trias but the head government ended up choosing a far   more modern design with a grid plan by Ildefons Cerdà. Eventually the local and   head government agreed add a new plan. A design by the architect Puig i   Cadafalch (author of the  modernist building &apos;Casa de les Punxes&apos;) resulted in   the current enormous sq&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Eixample is Catalan for ´extension´, meaning an extension of the old Barcelona city. Eixample was designed by Catalan-born urban planning visionary, Ildefons Cerdà, who took traffic and sunlight (amongst many other things) into consideration when creating the plans for this new district. Eixample is now characterised by its octagonal blocks and its grid-like pattern, with wide streets and both commercial and residential areas. It is split into two parts, Eixample Esquerra (Left, or in Spanish, Izquierdo) and Eixample Dret (Right, or in Spanish, Derecho), both of which are home to some fantastic restaurants and stores. Eixample Izquierdo is delimited by the grand, Passeig de Gràcia, a paradise for shopping and dining, and Plaça d´Espanya, where the Montjuïc Magic Fountain and one of the biggest convention centres in Barcelona can be found. The Parc de Joan Miró, with its iconic ´Woman and Bird´ sculpture created by the Barcelona-born artist, is also situated here, as well as the Arenas &quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;La Barceloneta es un barrio marinero del distrito de Ciutat Vella de Barcelona.Actualmente, el barrio sigue teniendo ese aire de pueblo ajeno a la ciudad que siempre le ha caracterizado. Pero el ambiente ha cambiado mucho, sobre todo, en verano. Su playa es una de las más animadas de la ciudad tanto de día como de noche, cuando abren los chiringuitos y bares musicales instalados en la misma arena donde se puede ir a cenar o a tomar una copa hasta altas horas de la madrugada.Junto a esta cara moderna, la Barceloneta sigue oliendo a sal y a ambiente marinero. Para muchos es todo un lujo que todavía se conserve un barrio de este tipo en una ciudad como Barcelona. Y es que resulta algo extraño que junto a calles estrechas, húmedas y ennegrecidas por el salitre, convivan alguno de los mejores restaurantes de la ciudad y atraquen lujosos barcos.&quot;</bucket>

Mostly there are former fishermen, dockers and dispatchers, once Alfandega (actual Congress Centre) was a former maritime port and custom house, a few decades ago. There´s a nice bakery just next door, grocery at 50 meters. There´s lots of restaurantes (francesinhas, traditional, vegetarian and sushi) in a 400 m radius maximum. The place is in the heart of \&quot;Festa de São João do Porto\&quot; (Festival of St John of Porto) in the June 23rd night. This night is memorable, everybody marching through the city.
